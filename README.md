Split Recursive &lt;ul> with jQuery


I had to split a long, recursive (multi-level) html ul list at a given point - which ended up as being trickier as it might seem at first.

Here is my test-code of a working implementation to split a list.


Note: This is not a jQuery plugin. It's just some bunch of code that uses jQuery.
